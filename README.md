# meta-portfolio
This project was part of the Meta Front-end Developer certification, specifically within the HTML and CSS in Depth module. The primary objective was to deepen understanding of modern layout techniques in web development. As a key component of the course, this assignment challenged participants to demonstrate their proficiency in creating responsive and efficient web layouts using either CSS Grid or Flexbox.
The project's core focus was on practical application of layout concepts, allowing students to choose between Grid and Flexbox for their implementation. This approach not only provided hands-on experience with these powerful CSS tools but also encouraged critical thinking about which layout method would be most suitable for different design requirements. By completing this peer-reviewed assignment, participants were able to showcase their ability to structure web content effectively, a crucial skill for front-end developers in today's responsive web design landscape. The project served as a practical assessment of the theoretical knowledge gained throughout the module, reinforcing the importance of mastering advanced CSS techniques in professional web development.
